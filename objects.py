# everything in python is an bject
# - strings, integers, lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets, functions

# you can create objects using classes
# - if an existing type is not adequate for your needs, build your own using classes

# functions associated with instances of Objects are known as methods

# methods used so far
'''upper(), lower(), split(), find(),
append(), pop(), remove(), insert(), sort(),
items(), keys(), values()...'''

OOP -> programming paradigm(model/method)
1. uses inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation and more
2. used extensively in software development
3. clean, efficient way of packaging, reusing, and maintaining code
